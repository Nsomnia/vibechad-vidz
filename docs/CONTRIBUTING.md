<h1 align="center">⚔️ Contributing to VibeChad: Sharpen Your Blades (and Your Code) ⚔️</h1>

<p align="center">
  <i>So, you think you've got what it takes to join the ranks of the VibeChad developers? Excellent. We're always looking for fellow Chads (and Chadettes) who aren't afraid of a little C++ and a lot of good vibes. This isn't your average open-source project where we hold your hand. This is where you prove your mettle.</i>

## 🎯 Our Philosophy: No Junior Dev BS

We operate on a simple principle: **Quality over Quantity**. Don't submit half-baked ideas or pull requests that look like they were generated by a rubber duck. We expect clean, well-tested, idiomatic C++20 code. If you're not sure what that means, maybe go re-read "Effective C++" a few times.

We value:
*   **Arch Linux Native Spirit:** Solutions that feel right on Arch. If it works better elsewhere, great, but Arch is home.
*   **Performance:** Every cycle counts. No unnecessary allocations, no O(n^2) loops where O(n) will do. Profile your code.
*   **Elegance:** Code should be a work of art. Readable, maintainable, and devoid of cruft.
*   **Respect for ProjectM:** We integrate, we don't interfere. Understand how ProjectM works before you try to "fix" it.

## 🚀 How to Contribute: The VibeChad Way

### 🐛 Found a Bug? (Impossible, but okay)

If you *somehow* stumble upon a bug, first, double-check your system. Did you update Arch recently? Are your drivers pristine? If, after extensive self-reflection, you still believe it's a VibeChad issue:

1.  **Search Existing Issues:** Has another Chad already reported this? Don't be that person who opens duplicates.
2.  **Open a New Issue:** Provide *all* the relevant details.
    *   **Steps to reproduce:** Clear, concise. Don't make us guess.
    *   **Expected behavior:** What *should* happen.
    *   **Actual behavior:** What *did* happen.
    *   **Your environment:** OS, kernel version, compiler, Qt version, ProjectM version. The more info, the less we have to ask.
    *   **Stack trace (if applicable):** If it crashed, give us the goods.

### ✨ Got an Idea for a Feature? (Be prepared to defend it)

New features are great, but they need to align with the VibeChad vision.

1.  **Open an Issue First:** Before you write a single line of code, describe your idea. Explain the *why*, not just the *what*.
2.  **Discuss:** We'll debate it. We'll poke holes in it. We'll ask tough questions. If your idea survives, then and *only then*, consider writing code.

### 💻 Ready to Code? (Prove your Chad-ness)

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Classic Git workflow. You know the drill.
2.  **Create a New Branch:** Name it something sensible. `feature/your-awesome-feature` or `bugfix/that-pesky-bug`.
3.  **Code Your Heart Out:**
    *   **C++20 Standard:** Use it. Love it. Live it.
    *   **Indentation:** Spaces, not tabs. 4 spaces. Fight me in the comments, but not in the code.
    *   **Naming Conventions:** Follow existing patterns (`CamelCase` for classes, `snake_case` for variables/functions).
    *   **Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*. If your code needs extensive comments to be understood, it's probably too complex.
    *   **Tests:** If your change is significant, consider adding a unit test. We're not savages.
    *   **Build & Test:** Ensure your code compiles without warnings and runs flawlessly on *your* Arch system.
4.  **Commit Messages:** Descriptive, concise. Start with a verb (e.g., `feat: Add new visualization mode`, `fix: Resolve segfault in audio engine`).
5.  **Push to Your Fork:**
6.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   **Reference Issues:** Link to the issue your PR addresses (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    *   **Describe Your Changes:** Don't just say "fixes bug." Explain *how* you fixed it and *why* your solution is superior.
    *   **Be Patient:** We're busy Chads. We'll review it when we have time. Be prepared for constructive criticism. Take it like a Chad.

---

## 🚫 What Not to Do (Seriously, don't)

*   **Massive, Unrelated Changes:** Keep your PRs focused. One logical change per PR.
*   **Commit directly to `main`:** Instant ban. No exceptions.
*   **Introduce new dependencies without discussion:** Every dependency adds overhead. Make a strong case.
*   **Act like a Karen:** This is a chill project. We expect respect. See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for details.
*   **Force Push:** Unless you absolutely know what you're doing and have cleared it, just don't.
