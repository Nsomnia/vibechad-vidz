  <i>We're all here to make VibeChad the most epic audio visualizer on the planet. To do that, we need a community where everyone feels respected, valued, and can contribute without fear of being treated like a Windows user.

## 🔥 Our Pledge: We're All Chads Here

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 🌟 Our Standards: The Chad-like Behavior We Expect

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   **Demonstrating Empathy and Kindness:** Treat others as you'd want to be treated. Even if they use `vim`.
*   **Being Respectful of Differing Opinions, Viewpoints, and Experiences:** We're not a hive mind. Debate is healthy; personal attacks are not.
*   **Giving and Gracefully Accepting Constructive Feedback:** We're all here to learn and improve. Your code might be brilliant, but it could always be *more* brilliant.
*   **Accepting Responsibility and Apologizing to Those Affected by Our Mistakes:** We all screw up. Own it, fix it, move on.
*   **Focusing on What is Best Not Just for Us as Individuals, But for the Overall Community:** The project's success is a collective effort.

## ⚡ Unacceptable Behavior: Don't Even Think About It

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   **Harassment:** Offensive comments related to the aforementioned personal attributes, sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   **Trolling, Insulting or Derogatory Comments, and Personal or Political Attacks:** Keep it civil. Keep it technical.
*   **Public or Private Harassment:** This includes stalking, intimidation, or sustained disruption of discussions.
*   **Publishing Others' Private Information:** Don't dox anyone. That's just low.
*   **Other Conduct Which Could Reasonably Be Considered Inappropriate in a Professional Setting:** Use your common sense. If you wouldn't do it at a tech conference, don't do it here.
*   **"I use Arch, BTW" without actually using Arch:** This is cultural appropriation and will not be tolerated. (Just kidding... mostly.)

## 🚨 Enforcement Responsibilities: The Ban Hammer is Ready

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 💀 Scope: Where the VibeChad Rules Apply

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

---

##  신고 (Reporting): If You See Something, Say Something

If you are experiencing or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it immediately by contacting the project maintainers at [your-email@example.com] (placeholder - I'll update this in a real project).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
