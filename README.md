## 🎵 What is vibechad-vidz?

`vibechad-vidz` is a music video creator and automator designed for the modern AI music creator. It's built on the legendary `ProjectM` visualization engine, giving you the power to create stunning, professional-looking music videos with a "leet" level of customization.

This isn't just another visualizer. `vibechad-vidz` is a full-fledged video creation pipeline, with features like:

*   **Advanced ProjectM Integration:** We're not just using ProjectM, we're extending it. Get ready for framebuffer rendering, animated text, and more.
*   **Karaoke-style Lyrics:** Integrate lyrics directly into your videos for that professional touch.
*   **YouTube Pipeline:** A streamlined workflow to get your creations from your desktop to YouTube with minimal fuss.
*   **Sleek, Modern UI:** A user interface designed for power users who appreciate a clean, efficient workflow.

If you're tired of the AI slop and want to create something truly unique, `vibechad-vidz` is for you.

### ✨ Key Features (Because we don't do "basic")

*   **Advanced ProjectM Integration:** Harness the full power of ProjectM for dynamic, psychedelic, and customizable visualizations. We didn't reinvent the wheel; we just put some sick rims on it.
*   **Intuitive Qt6 UI:** A user interface so clean, your grandma could probably use it. But she won't, because she's too busy enjoying her vinyl collection.
*   **Real-time Audio Analysis:** Analyzes your audio in real-time, feeding delicious data to ProjectM for visuals that actually react to your tunes, not just some pre-baked nonsense.
*   **Overlay Engine:** Integrate text overlays. Because sometimes, you just need to drop some wisdom or memes on your visual output.
*   **Built-in Video Recorder:** Capture your epic visual journeys directly within the app. Share your vibes with the less fortunate (i.e., non-Arch users).
*   **Configurable to the Max:** Tweak every knob, slide every slider. Because true Chads customize everything.

## 🛠️ Get That Vibe: Building from Source

You use Arch, BTW. So building from source is practically foreplay.

### Prerequisites (The non-negotiables)

Before you embark on this glorious journey, ensure you have these bad boys installed:

*   **CMake** (>= 3.20)
*   **Qt6** (Core, Gui, Widgets, Multimedia, OpenGLWidgets, Svg)
*   **spdlog**
*   **fmt**
*   **taglib**
*   **toml++**
*   **GLEW**
*   **GLM**
*   **FFmpeg** (libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil, libswscale, libswresample)
*   **ProjectM** (v4 preferred. If you don't have it, consider running `scripts/install_projectm_v4_local.sh` or building it yourself. We're not your mom; figure it out.)

On Arch Linux, you can probably snag most of these with pacman:
```bash
sudo pacman -S cmake qt6-base qt6-multimedia qt6-svg spdlog fmt taglib tomlplusplus glew glm ffmpeg
# For projectM, check AUR or build it. A script is provided for local build.
```

### The Sacred Ritual: Compilation

```bash
# Clone this repo (if you haven't already, peasant)
git clone https://github.com/Nsomnia/vibechad-vidz.git
cd vibechad-vidz

# Build the beast
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # Or Debug, if you like living dangerously
make -j$(nproc)

# Install (because you're worth it)
sudo make install
```

If `make install` gives you the cold shoulder, just run it from the `build` directory:
```bash
./vibechad-vidz
```

### 📦 Arch User Repository (AUR)

For the truly enlightened, `vibechad-vidz` might just land in the AUR eventually. Keep an eye out. Until then, compiling is character building.

## 🧠 Configuration (For the Control Freaks)

VibeChad uses `toml++` for its configuration. The default configuration can be found in `config/default.toml`. Feel free to tweak it to your heart's content. Just try not to break everything. We're not responsible for your existential dread when your custom config vanishes into the ether.

---

## 🤝 Contributing (Show Us Your Code, Chad)

Think you can make VibeChad even more Chad-tier? Prove it. We welcome contributions, but only if they're up to snuff. No junior-dev-level pull requests, please. Read our `CONTRIBUTING.md` (once I write it, give me a minute) for the lowdown.

## 📜 License

(Yes, I will add a `LICENSE` file. Don't rush me.)

## 🚀 The Future (Because we're always elevating)

We've got big plans, bigger vibes. Expect more features, more optimizations, and probably more "I use Arch, BTW" jokes. Stay tuned, stay Chad.
